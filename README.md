# Generating-Text
This repository contains a project focused on text generation using deep learning models. The primary goal is to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given input.

# Overview
The project leverages sequence models like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks), or Transformers to generate text. These models are trained on a large corpus of text data to learn the patterns and structures of language.

# Preprocessing
Preprocessing steps include:

* Tokenization: Splitting text into tokens or words.
* Text Normalization: Converting text to lowercase, removing special characters, etc.
* Sequence Padding: Ensuring that all input sequences are of the same length.
 
# Model
Several models have been explored for text generation, including:

* LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
* GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
* Transformer

# Training
The model is trained on the preprocessed text data using a sequence-to-sequence approach. The training process involves tuning hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs to achieve the best performance.

# Installation
'''bash
git clone https://github.com/Osama-Anmar/Generating-Text.git
cd Generating-Text
